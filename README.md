## FAQ ‚ùì

### Is this safe to run in production?

Yes, with proper configuration. The platform includes safety guardrails to limit the blast radius of experiments and prevent cascading failures. We recommend starting in a staging environment and gradually moving to production.

### How does this compare to Chaos Mesh or Litmus Chaos?

While all three are Kubernetes-native chaos engineering tools, Chaos Engineering as a Platform focuses on providing a more comprehensive solution with enhanced safety features, external API testing capabilities, and deeper metrics integration.

### Can I extend the platform with custom experiments?

Absolutely! The platform is designed to be extensible. You can create custom experiment types by implementing the experiment interface and registering them with the platform.

### What Kubernetes versions are supported?

The platform supports Kubernetes 1.19 and above. It has been tested extensively on GKE, EKS, AKS, and self-managed Kubernetes clusters.

### Is there a hosted/SaaS version available?

Not yet, but it's on our roadmap. For now, you'll need to deploy and manage the platform yourself.

## Security üîí

Chaos Engineering as a Platform takes security seriously. The platform includes several security features:

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for different user roles
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all actions for accountability
- **Secure API**: Authentication and authorization for all API endpoints
- **Protected Namespaces**: Prevent experiments from affecting critical infrastructure
- **Secure Defaults**: Conservative default settings to prevent accidental damage

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to security@example.com. All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.
